###### This repository contains a few of the little things I made while learning Python as a complete coding beginner.
###### Not intended for any use. Written to learn some basic concepts like conditional logic and handling different data types.

## Caesar Cypher
One of the most famous and simplest encryption methods for text. Input a string to have each character substituted for another. The program allows the user to specify the rotation count.

For more information, see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

## Fibonacci
Prints the first 10 instances of the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

Each number is the sum of the two numbers that came before it in the list, for example, *0 1 1 2 3*...

## Fizzbuzz
One of the most famous/infamous beginner coding challenges, commonly used as an interview question.

###### Instructions:
- Write a program that prints the numbers 1-100.
- For each number that is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz".
- For each number that is divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz".
- For each number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "Fizzbuzz".

## Image Downloader
The script asks for an image hyperlink and saves it to the local directory on the computer.

Written to learn how to save a file with Python, as well as an introduction to the 'requests' library.

## Random Number
The user enters a lower and upper range to the console, and the script generates a random number within the specified range.

Written to learn a simple introduction to the 'random' library.

## Random Number Tester
After learning about the 'random' library and how it can only be considered [pseudo-random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness), I wanted to write a simple tool to test just how random the library was when used.

The script basically performs a "coin toss" between two integers, as many times as the user specifies. It also aggregates the data to present a running total of results.

## Range Add
Enter a low number and a high number, and the script will total up each number within the specified range.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
Just like the [real-life game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors), except without anything resembling any kind of fun.

Input your choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors", and the script will randomly select a competing choice. The result is then printed to the console with the winner announced.
